Black Duck, a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool, helps with managing the supply chain of software, understanding the third-party components in use and minimizing risks from known vulnerabilities and licensing. Black Duck is a comprehensive solution for supply chain management, based primarily on source analysis.

Using Black Duck, you can:

Scan your code and identify open source software that exists in your code base.

View the generated Bill of Materials (BOM) for your software projects.

View vulnerabilities that have been identified in open source components.

Assess your security, license, and operational risk.

Protex users can use Black Duck to view and manage security vulnerabilities in their existing BOMs
